@PP
The aim of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is to model the continuous fluids by applying mathematical resources on the equations that govern the fluid flow, the Navier--Stokes (NS) equations. In order to obtain a valid solution efficiently, a good understanding of the physics that come into play in the problems is required, as well as computer operations and power management knowledge. Information related to these topics is found in this document.

@PP
The solver soon-to-be developed will fall under the category of numerical solvers, which use numerical analysis to compute an approximation of the desired solution. Note that solving the NS equations analytically for the vast majority of practical applications is impossible @FootNote { If the reader is interested in developing an analytical solver, an obligatory step is to solve the renowned Millenium Prize Problem stated by the Clay Mathematics Institute, which challenges the fearless mathematician to proof the existence and smoothness of NS solutions. }.

@PP
Because my Final Year Project (FYP) will be related to a project aimed at developing a solver for the NS equations, I must make sure that the inner workings of a basic solver are fully understood by the time I start coding for the FYP. I have written this report to summary the information gathered from different sources and document my progress. The reader must know that this document will suffer constant changes until I feel sufficiently confident to pursue the FYP. Once I devote myself to the FYP, this document will be freezed and remain as proof of the work done.

@PP
This document is typeset with and compiled using Lout. In this project Lout is used as a document formatter similar to @LaTeX, so I can test the convenience of writing the FYP using the former tool. The initial idea is to write the FYP in Lout, so I can reuse some of the parts of these document without modification.

@PP
It is recommended that the reader has a good understanding of Fluid Mechanics so the assumptions and the equations presented are grasped.
